# Web Scraping Project
This project is done as a final assessment project for the class Web Scraping for Data Science and Business Analytics program at WNE, University of Warsaw.
Our project aims to create a comprehensive mobile phone dataset by scraping data from the popular e-commerce website Flipkart.com. We will be utilizing the power of web scraping using three different tools: BeautifulSoup, Selenium, and Scrapy. We will save it in a structured format, such as CSV or Text for each of the methods used. The information that is extracted is the same in each case and for each method, there are 2 files saved. One file contains the links of each webpage for each phone. The second file contains useful information from each webpage to gather phone specifications.
